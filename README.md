# ReCaptcha_Bypass
Dummy python script to bypass google's captcha

This script bypasses google's recaptcha using google's speech to text api, and it does a pretty descent job.
There is indeed plenty of room for optimization  & improvement in the script. However, what matters most is that it works.

To run the script, after installing the dependencies found at requirements.txt and ffmpeg 5.1.4, simply call the function `SolveRe` and pass it a selenium driver as an argument (after getting the desired page ofc).

Note: The script was tested and worked with Python 3.11.2, ffmpeg 5.1.4, and the packages provided in the requirements.txt file.
