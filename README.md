# ReCaptcha_Bypass
Dummy python script to bypass google's captcha

This script bypasses google's recaptcha using google's speech to text api, and it does a pretty descent job.
There is indeed plenty of room for optimization  & improvement in the script. However, what matters most is that it works.

To run the script, you simply have to call the function `SolveRe` and pass it a selenium driver as an argument.
